# Data Browser

The {{site.data.keyword.composeForRabbitMQ_full}} service comes with access to the management UI provided by the RabbitMQ [Management Plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html).

When you click _Data Browser_ a login screen appears in a new tab. You can find your login credentials in your service's connection string. The user and password values are in the section of the string after the `amqps://` and before the `@`, in the format `user:password`.

Once you have logged into the UI you can manage exchanges, queues, bindings, virtual hosts, users, and permissions.

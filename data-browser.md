The {{site.data.keyword.composeForRabbitMQ_full}} service comes with access to the management UI provided by the RabbitMQ [Management plug-in](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html).

Click _Data Browser_ to open a login screen in a new tab. You can find your login credentials in your service's connection string. The user and password values are in the section of the string after√ü `amqps://` and before `@`, in the format `user:password`.

After you log in to the UI you can manage exchanges, queues, bindings, virtual hosts, users, and permissions.
